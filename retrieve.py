    Description:  
    The Back End Developer Trainee internship offers a hands-on opportunity to contribute to server-side development for real-world applications. The role focuses on building and maintaining server-side logic, APIs, and databases, writing clean and scalable code in languages like Python, Node.js, or Java. The trainee will assist in integrating front-end elements with server-side systems, work with databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB, and participate in testing, debugging, and performance tuning. Documentation of code and backend processes is also part of the role. This is a remote internship for 1â€“3 months, with mentorship and the potential for a full-time opportunity.
    
    Required skills:  
    Candidates should have a solid understanding of one or more backend programming languages (Python, Node.js, or Java), basic knowledge of RESTful API design and development, and familiarity with relational and/or NoSQL databases. Good problem-solving and analytical skills, as well as the ability to work independently in a remote environment, are essential. Experience with Git, backend frameworks (such as Express.js, Django, or Spring Boot), secure coding practices, authentication and authorization concepts, and exposure to Docker, cloud platforms, or CI/CD pipelines are desirable additional skills.
